PhantomHack,

Your task is critical to the next phase of E-Corp's plans. You’ve served us well, but we need you to do one last thing before you disappear into the shadows. The encrypted file must be sent over to our servers as soon as possible. Make sure no traces remain. E-Corp cannot afford to be caught off guard.

As per our recent communications, your access to the next phase is confirmed. You know the protocol—passcode: "H4ck3d_P@ss" will get you the credentials for the next secure stage.

We trust you'll deliver as expected, or your... association with us will come to a swift end.
